# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback – American Express

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of Break Through Tech’s AI Studio in partnership with American Express. Our team built a sentiment analysis pipeline to classify customer feedback into positive or negative sentiment categories.

## Objectives and Goals
- Apply supervised machine learning to real-world financial data
- Build an end-to-end sentiment classifier
- Achieve high accuracy and improve upon baseline models
- Promote fair and ethical AI development practices

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization using spaCy
- Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization
- Modeling: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Bias Mitigation: Analyzed performance across demographic subgroups

## Results and Key Findings
- Our SVM model achieved **85% accuracy**, outperforming the baseline by 20%.
- The model showed robust performance across diverse feedback categories.
- Identified minor class imbalance issues, which we mitigated with resampling techniques.

## Visualizations
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- ROC curves for model comparisons
- Word clouds for positive vs. negative feedback

## Potential Next Steps
- Expand training data to improve generalization
- Integrate explainability tools (e.g., SHAP)
- Deploy the model via a web app dashboard
- Test for fairness using AIF360
